# Hotel-Recommenations

For this project, I am looking to see if creating predictive models for  a hotel recommendation system is possible. Using data from Kaggle, the goal is to find the best model to make hotel recommendations based on different factors of search criteria.

Business Problem: Online booking systems are a competitive and growing sector of the travel industry. To maximize booking opportunities, providing helpful and personalized recommendations may increase the number of successful bookings when a Guest is searching for their travel arrangements. Based on what the Guest is searching for, can we accurately recommend the right accommodations for them? What factors are most important when making recommendations? Does providing more personalized recommendations based on search really improve the booking success rate? Is there a model that we can apply to multiple types of consumers that can still give accurate results?

Data: The data I used is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/expedia-hotel-recommendations/data. The data is a random selection of customer searches and behavior from Expedia.
